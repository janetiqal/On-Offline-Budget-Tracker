# On-Offline-Budget-Tracker

## Description
A Progressive Web Application that allows users to add expenses or deposits to calculate their budget. Users are able to use the app whether they are offline or online. If the user is offline and adds items to their budget, when back online the database is updated. The key feature here is the use of IndexedDB which is used to store the data while offline.
